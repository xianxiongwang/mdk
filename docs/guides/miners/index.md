title: Run a miner Worker
description: Task guides for running MDK miner Workers — Antminer, Whatsminer, and Avalon. Each guide is independent; read only the one for your hardware.
docs@tether_slug: guides/miners

## Overview

MDK drives each miner brand through its own Worker. These guides are task-focused and **independent** — you only need the one for the hardware you operate.

> [!NOTE]
> If Kernel, Worker, manager, or thing are unfamiliar, read [terminology][terminology] first.

## Pick your hardware

The authoritative model list for every Worker is the generated [supported-hardware catalogue][catalogue-miners]. For example, you may:

- [Run an Antminer Worker][run-antminer]
- [Run a Whatsminer Worker][run-whatsminer]
- [Run an Avalon Worker][run-avalon]

## Prerequisites

Every guide assumes:

- Node.js >=24 (LTS)
- npm >=11
- Dependencies installed (`npm run setup` from the repo root)
- Commands are run from the repo root
- Outbound network access for Kernel discovery

For the mock/development path:

- No physical miner is required
- The runnable example for your model starts the bundled mock device and registers it

> [!IMPORTANT]
> HRPC relies on HyperDHT for peer connectivity. Use the [network requirements and checks][troubleshooting]
> if an example stalls before printing the Kernel key.

For the deployment path:

- A Node.js service or script in your deployment that runs the MDK Worker and registers devices
- A supported miner reachable from the machine or container running the Worker
- Access to the miner's native API and credentials, if that API requires them
- The Worker's `USAGE.md` for the exact `registerThing` options

## Next steps

- Browse [supported hardware][supported-hardware]
- New to the moving parts? Read [terminology][terminology] (Kernel, Worker, manager, thing, mock)
- If an example does not start or a mock port is busy, use [troubleshooting][troubleshooting]
- Drive the registered device from a dashboard: [run a mining site end to end][get-started]
