title: Run an Avalon Worker
description: Start an MDK Worker for a Canaan Avalon A1346 against a mock or a real device.
docs@tether_slug: guides/miners/run-avalon-worker
---

## Overview

This page details how to run the Canaan Avalon Worker. Select the development (mock) or real-device path.

## Prerequisites

Review [common deployment prerequisites][miner-guide-assumptions] before you start.

Deployment-specific requirements:

- A Node.js service or script in your deployment that runs the MDK Worker and registers devices
- A supported Avalon device reachable from the machine or container running the Worker
- The miner API reachable over the native CGMiner TCP API, typically port `4028`
- A `password` for each device: the CGMiner wire protocol itself does not authenticate, but the Worker's own config validation requires this field

<Steps>

<Step>

### Development

<details>
<summary>Run against a mock</summary>

To support development, this repo ships a runnable example that boots a mock A1346, starts a Kernel and Gateway, and starts the Worker (`startAvalonWorker`) against it:

```bash
node examples/backend/miners/avalon/index.js
```

It prints the Kernel HRPC key and the registered device ID, then stays running until Ctrl+C. For details on the boot options and mock, see [USAGE.md][avalon-usage].

### Connect a miner

#### 2.1 Confirm the model

Avalon ships one model family today, `a1346` — confirm this against the [USAGE.md][avalon-usage] as new models are added.

#### 2.2 Register your miner

Avalon devices use the native CGMiner TCP API on port 4028. The wire protocol itself does not authenticate, but the
Avalon Worker Plugin's own config validation rejects a device with no `password`. Add this code to the Node.js
service or script that runs the MDK Worker in your deployment. The snippet shows the minimum boot call seeding one
Avalon device; replace the example IP address and password with your miner's values:

```js
const { getKernel } = require('@tetherto/mdk/backend/core/mdk')
const { startAvalonWorker } = require('@tetherto/mdk-worker-avalon')

const kernel = await getKernel()

const worker = await startAvalonWorker({
  workerId: 'avalon-rack-1',
  model: 'a1346',
  storeDir: './store/avalon-rack-1',
  seedDevices: [{
    info: { container: 'site-1', serialNum: 'AV-001' },
    opts: { address: '192.168.1.30', port: 4028, password: 'admin' }
  }]
})
await kernel.registerWorker(worker.runtime.getPublicKey())
```

> [!WARNING]
> Make sure each miner's IP is reachable from the machine or container running the Worker before registering. Commands act on physical hardware — prioritize thermal safety.

`seedDevices` only seeds a fresh, empty `storeDir` — once persisted, the device set survives restarts on its own. To add a device to an already-running fleet, send the `registerThing` command to the live Worker instead:

```js
const { createMdkClient } = require('@tetherto/mdk/backend/core/client')

const client = createMdkClient({ kernelKey: kernel.getPublicKey() })
await client.connect()
await client.sendWorkerCommand('avalon-rack-1', null, 'registerThing', {
  id: 'AV-002',
  info: { container: 'site-1', serialNum: 'AV-002' },
  opts: { address: '192.168.1.31', port: 4028, password: 'admin' }
})
```

> [!IMPORTANT]
> `registerThing` persists the device config immediately, but the running Worker does not pick it up until it is stopped and restarted (`await worker.stop()`, then call `startAvalonWorker` again with the same `storeDir` and no `seedDevices`) — there is no hot-add.

Before running in a deployment, generate the Worker config (`common.json` for Worker identity, `base.thing.json` for device defaults and per-model alert thresholds):

```bash
cd backend/workers/miners/avalon
./setup-config.sh
```

For the full `seedDevices`/`registerThing` option reference and the mock `createServer` options, see the Worker's [USAGE.md][avalon-usage] and the shared [install pattern][install-pattern].

</Step>

</Steps>

## Troubleshooting

The development example on this page is [`examples/backend/miners/avalon/index.js`](../../../examples/backend/miners/avalon/index.js). A working run prints `Kernel HRPC key:` and `Device:`, then stays running until Ctrl+C.

If the example does not print both values, or if its mock port is already in use, follow [miner troubleshooting][miner-troubleshooting].

## Next steps

- Decide how to run the Worker service — [Deployment topologies][deployment-topologies]
- Review telemetry units, command shapes, and error codes — [`mdk-contract.json`][avalon-contract]
