# MDK monorepo docs

Use this page to route to the docs you need. 

## Getting started options

- [Connect your own hardware](guides/workers/build-a-worker.md)
- [Quickstart: run a mining site end to end](./tutorials/run-a-site.md)
- [Quickstart: build a dashboard](./tutorials/build-a-dashboard.md)
- [Pick your role](#pick-your-role)

## Domains

The monorepo is organized into three development domains:

- [Core](../backend/core/docs/README.md) — Kernel, Gateway, MCP server, MDK SDK, MDK client
- [Workers](../backend/workers/README.md) — protocol translators for data sources, e.g., miners, pools, power meters, sensors, containers
- [UI toolkit](../ui/README.md) — headless state and API contracts, React bindings, mining-domain components, and application scaffolding

> Per-artefact facts live next to code under `*/packages/**/<artefact>/`, not in `docs/`. 
> Workers ship `mdk-contract.json` (existing runtime contract); UI ships `dist/registry.json` (generated from JSDoc tags on source).

### New here

Start with the product, then the stack, then run something.

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| What MDK is and why it exists | [`concepts/about.md`](concepts/about.md) |
| How the pieces fit together | [`concepts/architecture.md`](concepts/architecture.md) |
| What the stack is made of, and where each piece is documented | [`concepts/architecture.md`](concepts/architecture.md#the-stack) |
| The vocabulary you need (Kernel, Worker, manager, thing, mock) | [`reference/glossary.md`](reference/glossary.md) |
| Run a complete site end to end | [`tutorials/run-a-site.md`](tutorials/run-a-site.md) |
| How Gateway, Kernel, and Workers communicate | [`concepts/control-plane.md`](concepts/control-plane.md) |

### Agent

You are an LLM consuming MDK at runtime.

| Topic | Where |
| --- | --- |
| Worker runtime contracts (machine-readable) | `backend/workers/<family>/<provider>/mdk-contract.json` |
| UI component registry (machine-readable) | `ui/<pkg>/dist/registry.json` (when shipping) |
| Per-workspace agent-ready entry points | [`../backend/workers/docs/AGENT_READY.md`](../backend/workers/docs/AGENT_READY.md), [`../backend/core/docs/AGENT_READY.md`](../backend/core/docs/AGENT_READY.md), [`../ui/AGENTS.md`](../ui/AGENTS.md) |
| Connect an AI agent to MDK over MCP | [`../backend/core/mcp/README.md`](../backend/core/mcp/README.md) |
| Install Agent Skills for your coding agent (Cursor, Claude Code) | [`../packages/mdk-skill/README.md`](../packages/mdk-skill/README.md) |

### Engineer

You build applications on MDK, or integrate a new device / pool / data feed.

MDK has two developer surfaces. A React layer for browser-based operator tools and UIs, and a Node.js layer for backend services,
scripts, and Gateway extensions. Your starting point depends on which you're building.

> [!NOTE]
> The React adapter and the Node.js client do not mirror each other one-to-one. Some Kernel operations — such as
> the write-action flow — have both a React hook and a Node.js `mdk-client` equivalent. Others, like telemetry,
> are exposed through the React adapter as higher-level domain hooks (for example `useMiners`, `useSiteHashrate`)
> with no direct `mdk-client` counterpart. If you are building UI, start with the [React adapter](../ui/packages/react-adapter/README.md); if you are
> building backend, start with [`mdk-client`](../backend/core/client/README.md) — do not expect a symmetric API between the two.
