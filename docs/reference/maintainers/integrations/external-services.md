# External services

Future Workers that pull data from third-party services — not hardware, not pools. Typically read-only feeds (network state, weather, market data).

| Service | Description | Worker package |
|---------|-------------|----------------|
| Bitcoin Mempool | Real-time network data, mempool stats, fee estimates | [`backend/workers/`](../../../../backend/workers/README.md) (TBD) |
| OpenWeather | Weather data for outdoor container operations | [`backend/workers/`](../../../../backend/workers/README.md) (TBD) |

No Worker has shipped yet — this page is a placeholder until the first external-service Worker arrives.
