title: Supported hardware
description: The miners, containers, power meters, and sensors MDK supports, plus mining-pool integrations — derived from each Worker's contract.
docs@tether_slug: reference/supported-hardware

## Overview

MDK integrates field hardware through Workers. Each Worker declares what it supports in its `mdk-contract.json`, and that contract is the single source of truth for coverage. Use this page to discover what Workers are supported.

## What MDK supports

- **Miners**: For example, Bitmain Antminer, MicroBT Whatsminer
- **Containers**: For example, Bitmain Antspace, Bitdeer
- **Power meters**: For example, ABB, Satec
- **Sensors**: For example, Seneca
- **Mining pools**: Protocol integrations such as Ocean, F2Pool

For the exact model lists, Worker packages, and per-Worker docs, see the generated catalogue:
