## Stack and hardware terms

This section explains the terms you need to familiarize yourself with, using an Antminer rack as an example.

| Term | What it is | Lives at |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Kernel** (Orchestration Kernel) | The pull-only kernel that owns the device registry, routes commands, and pulls telemetry on its own cadence — it performs no aggregation itself | [`backend/core/kernel/`][kernel-package] |
| **Gateway** | The developer-owned entry point between non-Node clients (UI, AI agents) and Kernel. Mandatory whenever a non-Node consumer reaches the kernel; not used in the in-process Antminer-rack example below | [`backend/core/gateway/`][gateway-package] |
| **Worker** | A device-family translator. Speaks the MDK Protocol upward to Kernel and the vendor's native API downward to one device family (one miner brand, one container type, one pool API). | [`backend/workers/`][worker-readme] |
| **Driver class** | The JavaScript class a Worker exports, one per device family (for example `Antminer`, `Whatsminer`), not one per model. Drives every device that Worker registers. | [`backend/workers/miners/antminer/lib/antminer.js`][antminer-worker] |
| **Thing** | One registered device instance. Created by sending a `registerThing` command to the Worker's provisioning service, not by calling a driver-class method directly. Identified by a generated `deviceId`. | [`backend/core/mdk/lib/services/provisioning.service.js`][provisioning-service] |
| **MCP** (Model Context Protocol) | The protocol AI agents use to discover and call tools. `@tetherto/mdk-mcp` runs either as its own standalone process, or in-process inside the Gateway when a plugin's routes are auto-generated into tools | [`backend/core/mcp/`][mcp-package] |

### How they compose, for an Antminer rack

```mermaid
flowchart TB
    subgraph clientLayer ["Your code"]
        Client["your script (e.g., client.js)"]
    end

    subgraph kernel ["Kernel"]
        Kernel["Kernel<br/>device registry · command routing · telemetry pull"]
    end

    subgraph workerLayer ["Antminer Worker"]
        AntminerWorker["e.g., AM_S21PRO"]
    end

    subgraph devices ["Antminer devices (real or mock)"]
        Miners["Antminers (HTTP / digest auth)"]
    end

    Client -->|"HRPC"| Kernel
    Kernel -->|"HRPC"| AntminerWorker
    AntminerWorker --> Miners
```

The same shape repeats for every other device family (Whatsminer, container vendors, pool APIs). [Scalability][architecture-scaling] covers the 
multi-Worker view, parallel Workers, and multi-site deployments.

## Hyperswarm RPC

MDK uses [`@hyperswarm/rpc`][hrpc-repo] as its runtime transport. Hyperswarm RPC (HRPC) is not an HTTP-based RPC system. It is an RPC layer
that rides on Hyperswarm peer-to-peer connectivity. The library is a simple RPC over the Hyperswarm DHT, backed by `Protomux`. Think of it as a peer-to-peer
remote function call system built on a DHT and an encrypted connection layer.

**Mental model** — Hyperswarm finds peers and establishes connections; `Protomux` divides the connection into named channels;
RPC defines the conversation — a caller names a method and receives a reply.

> [!NOTE]
> A useful analogy is a phone call between peers — Hyperswarm helps the phones find each other and connect; `Protomux` splits
> the line into channels; RPC defines how one side asks for a method and the other side responds.

**Practical implications:**

- You work with services, methods, requests, and responses — not URLs and routes
- The RPC-shaped API is identical across same-process, same-host, and distributed deployments; only the discovery
  mechanism changes (same-process registration, shared directory, or DHT topic)
- Peers discover and communicate without a central HTTP server

### HRPC on the same host

MDK uses HRPC as the single transport across all deployment shapes — same-process, same-host, and distributed.
Every component is addressed by its public key, not by a socket path or hostname. The Gateway, a standalone Node.js
script, and a remote service all connect the same way:

```js
createMdkClient({ kernelKey: key })
```

The Noise handshake that HRPC performs on every connection authenticates by key, so Kernel's allowlist works identically whether the caller is on the 
same machine or a remote host.

This is consistent with the broader Holepunch ecosystem philosophy — everything is a peer addressed by public key. When the peer is on the same 
machine it routes locally over the local network interface; the application code sees no difference.

## Next steps

- You are ready to run the example in [Run a mining site end to end][run-stack]
- Learn more about:
  - Multi-process discovery across machines: [Worker discovery][worker-discovery]
  - Gateway implementation details, including HTTP routing and plugin registration: [`backend/core/gateway/README.md`][gateway-package]
  - Building your own Worker for a new device family: see [the build walkthrough][build-a-worker]
  - The install and run pattern every shipped Worker package follows: [`backend/workers/docs/install-pattern.md`][worker-install]
  - Per-device contract details (telemetry units, command shapes, error codes): those live in each Worker's `mdk-contract.json`, e.g. [`backend/workers/miners/antminer/plugin/mdk-contract.json`][antminer-contract]
