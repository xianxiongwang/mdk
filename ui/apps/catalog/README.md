# @tetherto/mdk-catalog-ui

Catalog application showcasing the `@tetherto/mdk-react-devkit` component
library along with the headless core (`@tetherto/mdk-ui-foundation`) and its
React bindings (`@tetherto/mdk-react-adapter`).

## Getting Started

```bash
# Install dependencies (from root)
npm install

# Run the catalog app
npm run --workspace @tetherto/mdk-catalog-ui dev
```

## Features

This catalog showcases:

- Button variants and sizes
- Dialog components
- Checkboxes and switches
- Dropdown menus and tooltips
- Avatars
- Accordions
- Dashboard components (Active Incidents, Pool Details)
- Charts and data visualization
- And more!

## Development

```bash
# Type check
npm run --workspace @tetherto/mdk-catalog-ui typecheck

# Lint
npm run --workspace @tetherto/mdk-catalog-ui lint

# Build
npm run --workspace @tetherto/mdk-catalog-ui build
```

## Build info

The production bundle is aggressively minified with Terser, which strips
all `console.*` calls (`drop_console: true` in [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts)). To keep
build metadata available in deployed environments without weakening that
setting, build info is attached to the global `window` object and
appended to the document title at bootstrap.

### Inspecting a deployed build

Open the browser devtools console on any deployed page and run:

```js
window.__MDK_BUILD__
// → { version, branch, commit, commitDate, buildDate }

copy(window.__MDK_BUILD__)
// copies the full object to the clipboard for bug reports
```

The page title also carries the version suffix (for example,
`MDK UI Toolkit Catalog · v0.4.0`), so you can identify the running build at a glance
without opening devtools.

### Shape

`window.__MDK_BUILD__` matches the `__BUILD_INFO__` define injected by
Vite — see [`vite.config.ts`](./vite.config.ts) for how each field is populated, and
[`src/vite-env.d.ts`](./src/vite-env.d.ts) for the TypeScript declaration.
