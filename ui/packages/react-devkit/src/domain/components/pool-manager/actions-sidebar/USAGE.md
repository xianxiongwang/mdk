# ActionsSidebar

Full-height side panel that surfaces the reference app voting/approval workflow.
Lists local draft actions pending submission, actions already submitted (in
review), and actions raised by other operators that await your vote. Mirrors
the reference app's sidebar but is built on MDK primitives — no Redux, no Ant Design.

## Props

| Prop        | Type     | Required | Default | Description                            |
| ----------- | -------- | -------- | ------- | -------------------------------------- |
| `className` | `string` | no       | —       | Extra class on the sidebar root element. |

The sidebar is intentionally prop-light: it reads all state from `actionsStore`
and the `useLiveActions` hook internally.

## Minimal example

```tsx
import { ActionsSidebar } from '@tetherto/mdk-react-devkit'

// Mount once at the app root alongside the main content outlet.
// No props are required — the sidebar manages its own state.
export function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app-layout">
      <main><Outlet /></main>
      <ActionsSidebar />
    </div>
  )
}
```

## Pinned layout example

```tsx
// When the operator pins the sidebar, it enters a side-by-side flex layout.
// Wrap both the content area and ActionsSidebar in a flex row so the
// sidebar pushes the main content left instead of overlapping it.
export function AppWithPinSupport() {
  return (
    <div className="app-shell">
      <main className="app-shell__main"><Outlet /></main>
      <ActionsSidebar />
    </div>
  )
}
```

```scss
.app-shell {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: row;
  height: 100%;

  &__main {
    flex: 1;
    min-width: 0;
  }
}
```

## Data contracts

- **Drafts** — reads staged actions from `actionsStore` via `useActions()`.
  Each entry is a `PendingSubmissionAction` enqueued by the add / edit /
  assign-pool flows via `setAddPendingSubmissionAction`.
- **Live actions** — polls `GET /auth/actions` via `useLiveActions()` and
  partitions results into "In review" (mine) and "Requested" (others awaiting
  vote) buckets. The current user's email is resolved from `/auth/userinfo`.
- **Submit** — calls `useSubmitSingleAction` / `useSubmitPendingActions`;
  gated by the `actions:w` permission. After a successful submit the card
  briefly shows "Action Submitted" then disappears.
- **Vote** — calls `useVoteOnAction` for actions awaiting approval; also gated
  by `actions:w`.
- **Cancel** — calls `useCancelAction` for submitted actions awaiting execution.

## Notes

- Mount it **once** at the application root, outside the route `<Outlet>`, so
  drafts accumulated across Pool Manager sub-views remain visible.
- Requires `MdkProvider` (TanStack Query client + auth) above it in the tree.
- The **pin** feature switches to a flex-based layout — ensure the parent
  container uses `display: flex; flex-direction: row` so the sidebar pushes
  content rather than overlapping it.
