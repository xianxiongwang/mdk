 * The authentication seam.

 * `authStore` on a 401, `mdkFetch` read the token off it, `useTokenPolling`
 * hardcoded a 250 s `POST /auth/token` cadence, and the host app hand-rolled the
 * `?authToken=` capture in its entry file. Swapping any one of those meant
 * forking the package.
 *
 * An `AuthProvider` gathers those decisions into one object the app supplies.
 * MDK ships two: `bearerTokenAuth()` here (bearer token in `authStore`, 401 ends
 * the session — the generic default), and `gatewayRedirectAuth()` in the mining
 * preset, which adds the Gateway's OAuth redirect, token-refresh poll and role
 * parsing.
