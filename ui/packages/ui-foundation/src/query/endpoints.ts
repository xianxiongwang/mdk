/**
 * The mining Gateway's request paths (HLD §5) — one concrete
 * {@link EndpointMap}, and the default one, but no longer the only possible one.
 * A consumer pointing MDK at their own backend passes their own map to
 * `createMdkQueryClient`; the factories resolve paths from whichever map the
 * client carries.
 *
 * Paths are **templates**: a `:name` segment is substituted by `resolvePath`,
 * which URL-encodes the value. Previously the dynamic paths were assembled by
 * string concatenation at each call site, which meant the endpoint table alone
 * did not describe the API surface — and a forgotten `encodeURIComponent` was a
 * silent injection bug.
 *
 * @remarks
 * Not every `/auth/*` path here is illustrative: `site` and `featureConfig` are served by the default
 * `site-monitor` Gateway plugin. `tailLog`/`tailLogMulti` have no built-in plugin either, but the
 * [full-site](https://github.com/tetherto/mdk/tree/main/examples/full-site/plugins/site) and
 * [mvp-site](https://github.com/tetherto/mdk/tree/main/examples/mvp-site/backend/gateway-plugins/site) example
 * plugins serve the same tail-log data under a different route (`/site/history`) — useful as a pattern
 * reference, not a drop-in match. Every other path has no built-in or reference implementation anywhere in
 * this repo — create your own via a
 * [Gateway plugin](https://docs.tether.io/mdk/guides/gateway/plugins) matching your Worker/business logic. See
 * the consuming hook's own JSDoc (`ui/packages/react-adapter/src/hooks/`) for the exact status of the endpoint
 * it calls.
