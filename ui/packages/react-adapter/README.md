# @tetherto/mdk-react-adapter

React framework adapter for [`@tetherto/mdk-ui-foundation`](../ui-foundation/README.md). Binds
the Zustand vanilla stores and the TanStack `QueryClient` from the
headless core into React-native hooks.

## Surface

- `<MdkProvider apiBaseUrl={...}>` — wraps `QueryClientProvider` from
  `@tanstack/react-query` and exposes the resolved API base URL via
  React context. Required at the app root.
- Store hooks: `useAuth`, `useDevices`, `useTimezone`,
  `useNotifications`, `useActions` — one per core store, implemented
  with `useStore(<vanillaStore>)` from `zustand`.
- **`useDeviceAction()`** — queue a `DeviceActionSubmission` (built with
  the foundation's `buildXxx` helpers) into `actionsStore`; exposes
  `canSubmit` (checks `actions:w`). Device actions share the same review
  tray as pool actions.
- **`useThingComment()`** (`COMMENTS_WRITE_PERM`) — add, edit, and delete
  Thing comments against `/auth/thing/comment`; exposes `addComment`,
  `editComment`, `deleteComment`, `canComment` (`comments:w`), `isSaving`,
  and `error`; invalidates `list-things` queries on every write so the
  detail panel refreshes automatically.
- [Op Centre read hooks](#op-centre-read-hooks) — fetch, poll, and shape data for the Operational Centre pages.
- Write-action hooks — submit, vote, cancel, and query the server-side
  approval queue. Submission and direct vote/cancel hooks check `actions:w`;
  `useLiveActions()` also recognizes approver roles from the auth token.
- Re-exports of `useQuery`, `useMutation`, `useQueryClient` from
  `@tanstack/react-query` so consumers can stay on a single import path.

## Authentication

`<MdkProvider auth={...}>` takes an `AuthProvider` (from [`@tetherto/mdk-ui-foundation`](../ui-foundation/README.md)) —
the seam `useMdkAuth()` reads back. Three are available:

- `noAuth()` — no token, no sign-in, nothing to expire; for an open API or a fixture-backed demo
- `bearerTokenAuth()` — bearer token in `authStore`, session ends on a `401`; `createMdkQueryClient`'s own default
  when no provider is passed
- `gatewayRedirectAuth({ oauthBaseUrl })` (from the mining preset) — OAuth-redirect token capture, refresh polling,
  and role parsing against the bundled mining Gateway; `MdkProvider`'s own default, minus `oauthBaseUrl`, so
  `signIn()` throws until one is supplied

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The frontend seam is complete and tested, but `gatewayRedirectAuth()`'s `refresh()` calls `POST /auth/token`,
> served by `@tetherto/mdk-plugin-auth`, which
> [ships without working endpoints](../../../backend/core/plugins/README.md#the-bundled-auth-plugin), `/auth/userinfo` included.
> Bring your own [Gateway plugin](../../../docs/guides/gateway/plugins.md) serving `/auth/token`, or use `noAuth()` /
> `bearerTokenAuth()` against your own backend.

## Op Centre read hooks

These hooks own the fetch → render-shape transformation for the Operational
Centre pages (Site Overview and Explorer). All are tagged `@category
op-centre` in the machine-readable manifest (`npx mdk-ui hooks --category
op-centre`).

| Hook | Endpoint | Polling |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `useExplorerList(tab, options?)` | `GET /auth/list-things` | 60 s (inventory cadence) |
| `useThingDetail(id, options?)` | `GET /auth/list-things` | 20 s (realtime cadence) |
| `useRackLayout(params, options?)` | `GET /auth/list-racks` | 60 s |
| `useCabinetGroups(options?)` | `GET /auth/list-things` | 60 s |
| `useSite(options?)` | `GET /auth/site` | None — static config |
| `useFeatureFlags(options?)` | `GET /auth/featureConfig` | None — static config |
| `usePduLayout(params, options?)` | `GET /auth/pdu-layout` | None — static config |
| `useContainerSettings(options?)` | `GET /auth/global/data?type=containerSettings` | 60 s |
| `useContainerWidgets(options?)` | `GET /auth/list-things` + `GET /auth/tail-log` | Containers 60 s, realtime snapshots 20 s |

`useContainerWidgets` runs two independent queries: the container inventory
at the standard 60 s cadence (`POOL_MANAGER_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`) and the
per-miner realtime aggregate at a faster 20 s cadence
(`OP_CENTRE_REALTIME_POLL_INTERVAL_MS`). Both intervals are configurable via
`containersRefetchInterval` / `realtimeRefetchInterval` options.

`useFeatureFlags` and `usePduLayout` use `staleTime: Infinity` — the MDK is
single-site only, so these are fetched once per session and never
re-polled.

Import from `@tetherto/mdk-react-adapter/hooks` or the package root barrel.

> in `@tetherto/mdk-react-devkit` compose these hooks into page-ready shapes. Prefer the devkit
> wrappers in application code; use the adapter hooks directly when you need fine-grained polling
> control or are building new devkit features.

## Write-action hooks

These hooks connect the UI to the Gateway `/auth/actions*` routes and the Kernel
write-action approval path. Shared helpers live in [`action-write-utils.ts`](./src/hooks/action-write-utils.ts)
(`ACTIONS_WRITE_PERM`, `invalidateAfterActionWrite()`, `extractSubmitError()`,
`toVotingPayload()`).

| Hook                         | Use for                                                                                                              |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `useDeviceAction()`         | Queue a `DeviceActionSubmission` into `actionsStore`; build submissions with the foundation's `buildXxx` helpers.     |
| `useSubmitSingleAction()`   | Submit one staged action from the local `actionsStore` queue by id                                                    |
| `useSubmitPendingActions()` | Drain the entire staged queue, POST each action, clear the queue                                                      |
| `useVoteOnAction()`         | Cast an approve/reject vote (`PUT /auth/actions/voting/:id/vote`)                                                     |
| `useCancelAction()`         | Cancel one or more pending voting actions (`DELETE /auth/actions/voting/cancel`)                                      |
| `usePendingActions({ params?, refetchInterval?, enabled? })` | Fetch the server-side voting queue (`GET /auth/actions`); defaults to a 60 s poll interval unless overridden |
| `useLiveActions()`          | Query live actions every 5 s; partition into `[mine, others]` by submitter email and expose `canApprove` for `actions:w`, `admin`, `site_manager`, or `*` roles |
| `useThingComment()`         | Add, edit, and delete Thing comments; invalidates `list-things` on every write                                        |

`toVotingPayload()` in [`action-write-utils.ts`](./src/hooks/action-write-utils.ts) allowlists only the backend-recognized fields (`query`, `action`, `params`, `rackType`) when building the `POST /auth/actions/voting` body. Targeting reaches the backend solely through `query`: it's built from the action's `tags` as `{ tags: { $in: tags } }`, unless the action opts out with `overrideQuery: false` and supplies its own `query` (pool assignment does this). Every other client-only field (`tags`, `crossThing`, `codesList`, `poolName`, local queue `id`, …) is dropped.

Import from `@tetherto/mdk-react-adapter/hooks` or the package root barrel.

> For the cross-layer architecture, read [approval-gated writes](../../../docs/concepts/control-plane.md#approval-gated-writes).
> For implementation steps, read the [write-actions how-to](../../../docs/guides/gateway/write-actions.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisite:** `/auth/actions` has no default Gateway provider; bring your own
> [Gateway plugin](../../../docs/guides/gateway/plugins.md) serving the voting/approval queue shape
> these hooks expect. `useLiveActions()` also calls `useCurrentUserEmail()` internally
> (`@category auth`, `GET /auth/userinfo`, also no default provider) to partition `[mine, others]`;
> without it, every action is treated as "mine". See the
> [full-site example](../../../examples/full-site/plugins/site) for a working reference covering
> both routes.

## Example hooks

**`useSystemInfo()`**: Reference hook, not wired into any shipped page. Demonstrates the canonical
MDK data-fetch pattern end to end: composes three read-only Gateway endpoints (`GET /auth/site`,
`GET /auth/userinfo`, `GET /auth/featureConfig`) into one page-ready `SystemInfo` payload (`site`,
`email`, `roles`, `featureCount`) with a single `refetch`. Tagged `@category example` in the
machine-readable manifest.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Prerequisite:** `/auth/site` and `/auth/featureConfig` are served by the default `site-monitor`
> Gateway plugin, but `/auth/userinfo` has no default provider: the bundled `@tetherto/mdk-plugin-auth`
> ships unwired. Bring your own [Gateway plugin](../../../docs/guides/gateway/plugins.md) serving
> that route, or `email`/`roles` stay `undefined`. See the
> [full-site example](../../../examples/full-site/plugins/site) for a working reference.

## Machine-readable hook manifest

Every hook is listed in [`dist/hooks.json`](./dist/hooks.json) (regenerated at build time). Agents
and tooling can load it via the subpath export or the CLI:

```bash
npx mdk-ui hooks --format table
npx mdk-ui hooks --category permission
```

## Subpath exports

| Subpath       | Purpose                                       |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| `.`           | Top-level barrel                              |
| `./provider`  | `<MdkProvider>` + the `MdkContext` it powers  |
| `./hooks`     | Store hooks, write-action hooks, TanStack re-exports |
| `./hooks.json` | Machine-readable hook manifest (generated at build time) |

## Build strategy

`tsc -p tsconfig.build.json` emits ESM JS + `.d.ts` declarations into
`dist/`, and the package `exports` map resolves there. External npm
consumers get pre-built declarations and runtime JS — no compile step
required on their end.
