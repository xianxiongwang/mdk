 * Submits the locally-staged `actionsStore` queue to the voting/approval
 * workflow. This is the network half of the write flow: the devkit modals
 * only *enqueue* (`setAddPendingSubmissionAction`); nothing posted to
 * `/auth/actions` until this hook runs.
 *
 * Each staged action is POSTed via `submitActionMutation`. On success the queue
 * is cleared and the pool-config, miners, pools, and actions caches are
 * invalidated. Gated by `actions:w` — the backend remains the authoritative
 * check.
 *
 * @remarks
 * The `/auth/actions` endpoint is illustrative. MDK does not ship a built-in
 * endpoint for it — create your own via a
 * [Gateway plugin](https://docs.tether.io/mdk/guides/gateway/plugins) matching
 * your Worker/business logic. No reference implementation of `/auth/actions`
 * ships in this repo.
