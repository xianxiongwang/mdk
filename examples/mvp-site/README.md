# MDK MVP site example

A minimal, single-container mining site demo: Kernel, Gateway, Whatsminer
worker, Ocean pool worker, SATEC powermeter worker, and the MDK React UI.

## What you get

- **Kernel + Gateway** — the orchestration layer and its HTTP API, on `:3000`
- **Whatsminer worker** — mock miners, seeded from `config/devices.json`
- **Ocean pool worker** — mock pool stats on a fast demo-paced tick
- **SATEC powermeter worker** — mock power readings, scaled to the seeded miner count
- **MDK React UI** — Dashboard, Containers, Monitoring, Pools, and Control pages, served
  from the Gateway
- **Two MCP surfaces** — the Gateway auto-exposes its own routes as tools, and a second,
  hand-authored tool set ([`backend/mcp-plugins/site`](./backend/mcp-plugins/site/)) with agent-contract metadata and curated
  granularity the auto-exported routes can't provide. Both listed in
  [`.mcp.json.example`](./.mcp.json.example).
- **Independent processes** — every component above runs as its own PM2-supervised OS process

## Prerequisites

- Node.js >= 24
```bash
npm install -g pm2   # run once
```

## Setup

```bash
cd examples/mvp-site
npm run setup   
npm run setup:config
# installs backend/core, backend/workers, this example + its UI
```

## Start the site

```bash
npm start
```

[`start.js`](./start.js) generates a local `deploy/ecosystem.config.js` (not committed) from
[`config/site.deploy.json`](./config/site.deploy.json.example), starts the PM2 apps, then exits — PM2 itself keeps
the processes running in the background.

```bash
pm2 list      # mocks, mocks-ocean, mocks-satec, kernel, worker, worker-ocean, worker-satec, gateway, mcp
pm2 logs
```

Once `pm2 list` shows all apps `online`, open `http://localhost:3000/`.

## Stop the site

```bash
npm run stop:pm2
```

## UI pages

Dashboard, Containers (list + per-container detail), Monitoring (powermeter +
sensor charts), Pools, and Control — all served from `ui/dist` via the Gateway
at port `3000`. The Pools page shows the Ocean pool stats; the Monitoring page
charts the SATEC meter's power series.

## UI dev mode (hot reload)

```bash
npm run dev:ui
```

Starts the Vite dev server (default `http://localhost:3040`, override with
`MDK_UI_PORT`) proxying `/site/*` to the Gateway. Requires `npm start` to be
running separately so there's a Gateway to proxy to.

Rebuild the static bundle the Gateway serves with:

```bash
npm run build:ui
```

## Configure devices

### Seed devices

`config/devices.json` is gitignored (local/per-dev config). It is an object
keyed by device type — `miners` feed the Whatsminer worker, `powermeters` the
SATEC worker. Copy [`config/devices.json.example`](./config/devices.json.example) and adjust:

```json
{
  "miners": [
    {"info": { "serialNum": "WM-001", "container": "rack-1" }, "opts": { "address": "127.0.0.1", "port": null, "password": "admin" }},
    {"info": { "serialNum": "WM-002", "container": "rack-1" }, "opts": { "address": "127.0.0.1", "port": null, "password": "admin" }}
  ],
  "powermeters": [
    {"info": { "serialNum": "SATEC-001", "pos": "site" }, "opts": { "address": "127.0.0.1", "port": null, "unitId": 1 }}
  ]
}
```

Leave `opts.port` as `null` — each device is assigned its own mock port
automatically (miners from `mocks.portBase`, `14031` by default; powermeters
from `satec.mocks.portBase`, `15020` by default, in `config/site.deploy.json`).

To register **real devices**, set each entry's `opts.address`/`opts.port` to
the device's LAN address — Whatsminer API port (usually `4028`) for miners,
Modbus TCP address/port/`unitId` for SATEC PM180 meters. Keep `info.pos`
`"site"` on powermeters you want aggregated into the site power figures.

### Pool config (Ocean)

The Ocean pool is not a LAN device — its config lives in
`config/site.deploy.json` under `ocean`:

- `ocean.pool.apiUrl` — the pool REST API. Defaults to the local mock
  (`http://127.0.0.1:8010`). To go live, point it at the real Ocean API and
  remove the `mocks-ocean` role from `pm2.roles`.
- `ocean.pool.accounts` — the pool account username(s) to track. Replace
  `sample-ocean-account` with your account(s) to go live.
- `ocean.worker.tickMs` — demo pacer interval; stats refresh this often.

### SATEC config

`config/site.deploy.json` under `satec`:

- `satec.worker.thing` — snap collection/persist cadence (demo-fast, 5s).
- `satec.mocks.portBase` — Modbus mock ports. By default the reported power
  scales with the number of miners seeded in `config/devices.json` (split
  evenly across however many `powermeters` entries you configure); set
  `satec.mocks.powerW` to override with a fixed figure instead. Going live,
  remove the `mocks-satec` role from `pm2.roles` and point the `powermeters`
  entries in `config/devices.json` at the real meters.

## Reset state

Seed devices are only registered **once**, when a worker's store is
empty. If you change [`config/devices.json`](./config/devices.json.example) (miners or powermeters) after the
first run, clear state before restarting:

```bash
npm run stop:pm2
rm -rf .site-data
```

## Troubleshooting

### Kernel fails to start: `Invalid device file, was moved unsafely`

**Symptom**: PM2 shows `kernel` status as `errored` with:

```
Error: Invalid device file, was moved unsafely
```

**Cause**: The `.site-data` directory contains RocksDB files with embedded path metadata from a previous location. This happens when the repo is 
moved, copied, cloned to a new location, or when switching between multiple clones of the same repo.

**Fix**: Remove the persisted state directory:

```bash
npm run stop:pm2
rm -rf .site-data
```

The Kernel recreates `.site-data` with correct path metadata on next boot. All devices and history are re-seeded.

### Port conflicts

**Symptom**: A component fails to start with `EADDRINUSE`.

**Check**: Verify no other process is holding the required ports:

```bash
lsof -nP -iTCP:3000   # Gateway
lsof -nP -iTCP:8010   # Ocean mock
lsof -nP -iTCP:15020  # SATEC mock
```

Miner mock ports start at `14031`. If another example (e.g., [`examples/full-site`](../full-site/README.md)) or a previous run left processes
running, stop them first or edit [`config/site.deploy.json`](./config/site.deploy.json.example) to use different ports.

**Fix**: Stop stale PM2 processes:

```bash
npm run stop:pm2
```

### Stale PM2 processes after system crash

**Symptom**: `npm start` fails because components are already running, or ports are held.

**Check**: List PM2-managed processes:

```bash
pm2 list
```

**Fix**: Stop all PM2 apps:

```bash
npm run stop:pm2
```

If PM2 itself is unresponsive, kill all PM2 processes:

```bash
pm2 kill
```
