# MDK Ocean Minerpool Example (standalone)

A small, self-contained **Ocean** minerpool example you can clone and run with **no real hardware,
no Ocean.xyz account, and no network access**. It starts a mock Ocean API, drives the `OCEAN_POOL`
Worker against it, and prints a live pool snapshot (hashrate, Workers, balance, transactions,
blocks). It then stays running so [`verify.js`](./verify.js) can re-query the same mock.

## Why this one is standalone (no Kernel / gateway)

The miner and container examples (e.g. [`examples/backend/miners/antminer`](../../miners/antminer/README.md))
bring up a Kernel + gateway and boot their Worker via `WorkerRuntime`. `@tetherto/mdk-worker-ocean` does now
ship a Kernel-integrated boot function, `startOceanPoolWorker`, documented in the
[worker package README](../../../../backend/workers/minerpools/README.md). This particular example predates
that and still drives the manager directly, for a minimal demo with no Kernel/gateway dependency:

- `OceanMinerpoolManager` extends [`PoolService`](../../../../backend/core/mdk/lib/services/pool.service.js)
  from `@tetherto/mdk-core`. It has no `registerThing`, no `mem.things`, no `getThingType`: pool workers are
  not devices in the Worker Plugin sense.
- It's **config-driven**: the pool accounts and API URL come from `{ ocean: { accounts, apiUrl } }`
  at construction, and data is pulled with `fetchStats` / `fetchWorkers` / `fetchTransactions` /
  `fetchBlocks`.

So this example drives the pool manager **directly**, without a Kernel or gateway, exactly as
`startOceanPoolWorker` does internally. See the [worker package README][ocean-readme] for the Kernel-integrated
boot path, and [`examples/backend/miners/antminer`](../../miners/antminer/README.md) for a full Kernel +
gateway + `verify`-over-HRPC flow.

## What it demonstrates

- Running the `OCEAN_POOL` Worker against a mock Ocean.xyz REST API — zero hardware/account.
- Pulling pool **stats**, per-worker **hashrate**, **transactions** and **blocks** into the Worker store.
- Reading those back via `getWrkExtData()` / `getWorkers()`.

## Prerequisites

- **Node.js >= 24**
- Worker dependencies installed (from the repo root):

```bash
npm run setup:workers   # backend/workers packages (includes minerpool-ocean + its mock)
```

> Without this you'll get `Cannot find module ...` on first run.

## Architecture

  Index[index.js] -->|construct| Pool[OCEAN_POOL manager]
  Index -->|start| Mock[(mock Ocean API :5040)]
  Pool -->|HTTP REST| Mock
  Verify[verify.js] -->|own OCEAN_POOL| Mock
```

[`index.js`](./index.js) owns the mock; [`verify.js`](./verify.js) is a second process that spins up its own `OCEAN_POOL` against
the same mock. No Kernel, no gateway, no DHT.

## Quickstart

Clone-and-run — no config copy needed (falls back to [`config/mdk.config.json.example`](./config/mdk.config.json.example)):

```bash
node examples/backend/minerpools/ocean/index.js     # from the repo root
# or: cd examples/backend/minerpools/ocean && npm start
```

You'll see a pool snapshot, then `Press Ctrl+C to stop`. To customise (port, accounts), copy the
example and edit your own copy — it takes precedence:

```bash
cd examples/backend/minerpools/ocean
cp config/mdk.config.json.example config/mdk.config.json
```

## Verifying it works

With [`index.js`](./index.js) running in one terminal, run the check in another:

```bash
node verify.js        # or: npm run verify
```

It builds its own `OCEAN_POOL` against the running mock and prints per-account stats plus each
Worker's hashrate:

```
Ocean account: test
  hashrate: 5m=103.80 TH/s 1h=102.30 TH/s 24h=100.50 TH/s
  workers:  6 total, 5 online
  balance:  0 BTC   (est. today 0 BTC)
    └─ test.worker1  online=1  109.70 TH/s
    ...
OK — Ocean pool Worker is fetching live data from the mock API.
```

(The mock returns randomised values per run, so exact numbers vary.)

## Configuration reference

[`config/mdk.config.json`](./config/mdk.config.json.example) (copied from the `.example`):

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `mock.host` | Interface the mock Ocean API binds (default `127.0.0.1`). |
| `mock.port` | Port for the mock API (default `5040`). Also the URL the pool fetches from. |
| `accounts` | Ocean account usernames to query. The mock serves canned data for any name (default `["test"]`). |

## How it works

[`index.js`](./index.js):

1. Starts the mock Ocean API ([`backend/workers/minerpools/ocean/mock/server.js`](../../../../backend/workers/minerpools/ocean/mock/server.js)).
2. Constructs `new OCEAN_POOL({ ocean: { accounts, apiUrl } }, { rack, storeDir, root })` and `init()`s it.
3. Pulls data: `fetchWorkers` → `fetchStats` → `fetchTransactions` → `fetchBlocks` (stored in a local Hyperbee).
4. Reads it back: `getWrkExtData({ key: 'stats' | 'transactions' | 'blocks' })` and `getWorkers()`.
5. Stays running (keeps the mock up) until `Ctrl+C`, then stops the pool and closes the mock.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Fix |
|---|---|
| `Cannot find module ...` | Run `npm run setup:workers` from the repo root. |
| [`verify.js`](./verify.js) errors with `ECONNREFUSED` | Start [`index.js`](./index.js) first — it owns the mock the verifier queries. |
| `EADDRINUSE :::5040` | A previous run is still bound. `Ctrl+C` it, or change `mock.port`. |
| All metrics `n/a`/`0` | The mock randomises data; re-run. If persistent, confirm the mock is reachable at `mock.host:mock.port`. |
