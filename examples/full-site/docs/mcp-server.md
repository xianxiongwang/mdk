  # MDK MCP server

The full-site example ships an MCP server component that connects directly to the Kernel
via HRPC and exposes the site's device registry, telemetry, and command dispatch as MCP
tools. AI agents connect to it over HTTP; the service does not require the Gateway.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a purpose-built implementation for this example, not the shared
> [`@tetherto/mdk-mcp`](../../../backend/core/mcp/README.md) package — the tools and behavior described below are
> specific to `full-site`. For the shared package's own API (`createMcpServer`, plugin-based tools), see its
> [README](../../../backend/core/mcp/README.md); [`examples/mvp-site`](../../mvp-site/README.md) is the runnable
> example that uses it.

## Tools

The server exposes two sets of tools over the same endpoint.

### Agent-facing tools

These satisfy the [agent tool authoring contract][tool-contract]: each is named
`<verb>_<entity>`, takes only closed enums and device references, and returns a `summary` line
alongside its data. They declare routing metadata in `_meta["x-mdk-agent"]`, so an MDK agent
admits them and shows them to its model.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `summarize_site` | read | Worker and device totals by family and state, naming anything offline |
| `count_devices` | read | How many devices match a family and state |
| `list_devices` | read | Which devices match a family and state, named individually |
| `get_device` | read | One attribute of one device — telemetry, state, capabilities or power modes |
| `rank_devices` | read | Devices of a family ordered by a metric, highest or lowest first |
| `act_device` | **write** | Perform an action on a device. An agent gates this on operator approval |

### Direct-access tools

The original tools, for consumers that want the raw payloads. They carry no agent metadata, so
an MDK agent withholds them from its model rather than letting it read an unaggregated dump.

> **Breaking change:** `list_devices` already carried a contract-shaped name, so rather than
> registering a second tool under it, it moved into the agent set above. Its parameters changed
> from `type`/`status` to `family`/`state`, `ready`/`notready` became `online`/`offline`, and its
> rows no longer carry `type` or `workerState`. Direct callers of `list_devices` must update.
> Every other tool in this table is unchanged.

| Tool | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `get_status` | read | All registered Workers — state, health, device count, RPC key |
| `get_site_overview` | read | Site-wide inventory totals |
| `get_capabilities` | read | Command schema for a device (what `send_command` accepts) |
| `pull_telemetry` | read | Latest telemetry metrics from a device |
| `pull_state` | read | Current state snapshot (live readings, config) from a device |
| `get_supported_power_modes` | read | Power modes a device can be switched to |
| `send_command` | **write** | Dispatch a command to a device via the Kernel |

### Tool parameters

**`count_devices`**
```
family  enum  optional — miner | container | powermeter | sensor | pool | all, default "all"
state   enum  optional — all | online | offline, default "all"
```

**`list_devices`**
```
family  enum     optional — as above, default "all"
state   enum     optional — as above, default "all"
limit   integer  optional — 1..50, default 50 — how many to name
```

`count` is how many were **named**, `total` is how many **matched**. They differ once a fleet
runs past `limit`, and a caller reading `count` for the fleet size under-reports it — so read
`total` for "how many are there", and raise `limit` to see more of them.

**`get_device`**
```
ref     string  required — a device id
attr    enum    optional — telemetry | state | capabilities | power_modes, default "telemetry"
```

**`rank_devices`**
```
family  enum     optional — as above, default "all"
metric  enum     optional — hashrate | power | temperature | efficiency | uptime, default "power"
order   enum     optional — desc | asc, default "desc"
limit   integer  optional — 1..50, default 5
```

**`act_device`**
```
ref     string  required — a device id
action  enum    required — reboot | set_power_mode
mode    enum    optional — low | normal | high | sleep, default "normal" (set_power_mode only)
```

**`get_capabilities`**
```
deviceId  string  required
```

**`pull_telemetry`**
```
deviceId  string  required
query     string  optional — telemetry query type, default "metrics"
```

**`pull_state`**
```
deviceId  string  required
```

**`send_command`**
```
deviceId  string  required
command   string  required
params    object  optional — command-specific parameters, default {}
```

## Tool usage flow

The inputs for the various tools can be obtained as follows

### 1. `get_status`

**Description:** Get current status of all Workers and device counts.

**Inputs:** None — takes no parameters.

**How inputs are obtained:** N/A. It calls `client.getStatus()` with no arguments.

### 2. `get_capabilities`

**Description:** Get the capabilities (command schema) for a device.

| Input      | Type     | How to obtain                                                                       |
| ---------- | -------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deviceId` | `string` | From the device ID you want to query — typically discovered first via `get_status`. |

### 3. `pull_telemetry`

**Description:** Pull telemetry metrics for a device.

| Input      | Type                            | How to obtain                                                                                                                                         |
| ---------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `deviceId` | `string`                        | From a prior `get_status` call listing available devices.                                                                                             |
| `query`    | `string` (default: `"metrics"`) | The telemetry query type — defaults to `"metrics"` if omitted. Other values depend on what the device supports (discoverable via `get_capabilities`). |

### 4. `pull_state`

**Description:** Pull current state snapshot for a device.

| Input      | Type     | How to obtain                   |
| ---------- | -------- | ------------------------------- |
| `deviceId` | `string` | From a prior `get_status` call. |

### 5. `send_command`

**Description:** Send a command to a device (e.g. `reboot`, `set_power_mode`).

| Input      | Type                                      | How to obtain                                                                                                            |
| ---------- | ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `deviceId` | `string`                                  | From a prior `get_status` call.                                                                                          |
| `command`  | `string`                                  | The command name — valid commands are discoverable via `get_capabilities` for the target device.                         |
| `params`   | `Record<string, unknown>` (default: `{}`) | Command-specific parameters — their shape is defined in the device's capabilities schema returned by `get_capabilities`. |

**Typical agent workflow:** call `get_status` first to enumerate devices, then `get_capabilities` on a device to learn what commands/telemetry it supports, then use `pull_telemetry`, `pull_state`, or `send_command` as needed.

## Prerequisites

The MCP server only needs **kernel** running. At least one Worker and the mocks should
be up so there are live devices to query.

```
$ cd examples/full-site
$ npm install
$ node cli.js
```

From the CLI prompt, bring up the minimum set:

```
mdk> start mocks
mdk> start kernel
mdk> start worker whatsminer
```

Or boot everything except mcp-server at once (use a small fleet for speed):

```
mdk> up --miners 5
mdk> start mcp-server
```

## Starting

With kernel running, start the MCP server:

```
mdk> start mcp-server
```

The ProcessManager waits for the `MDK_READY` token before returning. Once the prompt
reappears the server is accepting requests at `http://localhost:3008/mcp`.

**Check it is running:**

```
mdk> ps
mdk> logs mcp-server
```

**Stop it:**

```
mdk> stop mcp-server
```

### Port

Default port is `3008`. If that port is already taken, the server walks upward
(`3009`, `3010`, …) until it finds one free, so a stale process or another
service on `3008` won't block startup. Check `logs mcp-server` (or the
`MDK_READY mcp-server port=…` line) for the port actually bound.

Override the starting port before launching the CLI:

```
MDK_MCP_PORT=4000 node cli.js
```

## Claude Desktop

Claude Desktop requires an HTTP proxy wrapper to reach a `Streamable HTTP` MCP server.
Add the following to its config file:

**macOS:** `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json`  
**Windows:** `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json`

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "mdk-site": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "@modelcontextprotocol/server-proxy"],
      "env": {
        "MCP_SERVER_URL": "http://localhost:3008/mcp"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

Restart Claude Desktop. The **mdk-site** tools will appear in the tool picker for any
new conversation.

> **Note:** Claude Desktop connects once on startup. If you restart the MCP server
> process, reload Claude Desktop (⌘R or restart the app) to reconnect.

## Programmatic access

Use the official MCP SDK to call tools from your own agent or script.

```
npm install @modelcontextprotocol/sdk
```

```js
import { Client } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/index.js'
import { StreamableHTTPClientTransport } from '@modelcontextprotocol/sdk/client/streamableHttp.js'

const transport = new StreamableHTTPClientTransport(
  new URL('http://localhost:3008/mcp')
)

const client = new Client({ name: 'my-agent', version: '1.0.0' })
await client.connect(transport)

// List all Workers
const status = await client.callTool({ name: 'get_status', arguments: {} })
console.log(JSON.parse(status.content[0].text))

// Pull telemetry for a device
const telemetry = await client.callTool({
  name: 'pull_telemetry',
  arguments: { deviceId: 'wm001', query: 'metrics' }
})

// Inspect what commands a device supports
const caps = await client.callTool({
  name: 'get_capabilities',
  arguments: { deviceId: 'wm001' }
})

// Send a command
const result = await client.callTool({
  name: 'send_command',
  arguments: { deviceId: 'wm001', command: 'reboot', params: {} }
})

await client.close()
```

## Test with curl

The endpoint speaks JSON-RPC 2.0 over plain HTTP POST, so curl is enough to
smoke-test it without a full client.

**Initialize:**

```sh
curl -sX POST http://localhost:3008/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 1,
    "method": "initialize",
    "params": {
      "protocolVersion": "2024-11-05",
      "capabilities": {},
      "clientInfo": { "name": "curl", "version": "0.0.1" }
    }
  }'
```

**Call `get_status`:**

```sh
curl -sX POST http://localhost:3008/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 2,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": { "name": "get_status", "arguments": {} }
  }' | jq .
```

**Call `pull_telemetry`:**

```sh
curl -sX POST http://localhost:3008/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 3,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "pull_telemetry",
      "arguments": { "deviceId": "wm001" }
    }
  }' | jq .
```

**Call `send_command`:**

```sh
curl -sX POST http://localhost:3008/mcp \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
    "jsonrpc": "2.0",
    "id": 4,
    "method": "tools/call",
    "params": {
      "name": "send_command",
      "arguments": { "deviceId": "wm001", "command": "reboot", "params": {} }
    }
  }' | jq .
```

## Example prompts

When connected through Claude Desktop or another MCP client, try these prompts to
exercise the tools:

- *"How many miners are currently online? Break it down by Worker."*
- *"Pull the latest telemetry for wm001 and flag anything abnormal."*
- *"What commands does the Whatsminer Worker support?"*
- *"Reboot wm003 and confirm the result."*
- *"Check the health state of every registered Worker. Flag anything that is not READY."*
- *"Get the current state of av001 and summarize its power consumption."*

> **Tip:** Ask the agent to call `get_capabilities` first on an unfamiliar device. It
> returns the full command schema, so the agent knows exactly what `send_command`
> accepts for that device type before sending anything.
