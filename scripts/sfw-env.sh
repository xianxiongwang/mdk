# Socket Firewall (SFW) allowlist for mdk-prv's local tooling.
#
# If your shell wraps npm/npx through `sfw` (a local security proxy — see the
# `command -v sfw` block most shell profiles add), it blocks any outbound host not
# explicitly allowed. `npm run link-check` (linkinator, see
# docs/reference/maintainers/linters.md) is the command that hits these — first its
# own ephemeral local crawl server, then every external link it finds in the repo's
# Markdown.
#
# Each bypass entry below is a host linkinator legitimately needs to *check* (not
# skip — see linkinator.config.json's `skip` list for URLs that are never checked
# at all; that's a different concern from this file, see the note in that config).
#
#   localhost                 linkinator's own local crawl server (random port per run —
#                              sfw matches on hostname, so the port doesn't matter)
