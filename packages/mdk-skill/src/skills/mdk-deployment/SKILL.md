# Deploy and run an MDK stack

In CLI-managed projects (this folder), the stack is declared in `mdk.yaml` and
started with `mdk run`. Boot order matters: **Kernel → workers → gateway/UI**.

## Project shape

```
<project>/
├── mdk.yaml                 # Stack spec (source of truth)
├── package.json             # private root manifest; workers/* + plugins/* are npm workspaces
├── plugins/<name>/          # Gateway plugins (mdk create plugin)
├── workers/<name>/          # Worker Plugin packages (mdk create worker)
├── apps/dashboard/          # UI shell (mdk create dashboard) — apps/<name> if named explicitly
└── .mdk/                    # runtime state written by `mdk run` — gitignored, disposable
```

`workers/*` and `plugins/*` are npm workspaces: one root `npm install` links
every component into the project's `node_modules`, which is how the Gateway
and `mdk run` resolve them. `apps/*` (the dashboard) is deliberately **not** a
workspace — it links the MDK UI packages by `file:` path and installs on its
own, so its React is never hoisted alongside those links.

## `mdk.yaml` essentials

```yaml
apiVersion: mdk/v1
kind: Stack
metadata:
  name: <stack-name>
spec:
  kernel:
    port: 3848
  gateway:
    port: 3847
    plugins:
      - package: <plugin-package-name>   # e.g. fleet-summary, or @org/name
        config: {}
  workers:
    - name: <worker-name>
      package: ./workers/<worker-name>   # local path, or an installed npm name
      config:
        mock: true
        devices:
          - id: dev-0
            opts: { host: 127.0.0.1, port: 18080, serial: DEV-0 }
```

Both `mdk create worker <name>` and `mdk create plugin <name>` scaffold the
package **and** register it here automatically (workers under
`spec.workers`, plugins under `spec.gateway.plugins`) — no manual
`package.json` linking step. They also seed a stack-unique mock port/device id
per worker, so scaffolding several in one project never collides. If you add a
package by hand instead, mirror that: `npm install` at the project root (which
links the new workspace member), then append the entry yourself.

## Run commands

```bash
mdk run                     # whole stack from mdk.yaml: kernel + workers + gateway together
mdk run kernel
mdk run gateway
mdk run worker <name>       # e.g. mdk run worker demo-miner
mdk run dashboard           # the scaffolded UI shell's dev server
```

`mdk run` with no target boots everything together; that's not a spec setting,
just which command you type. Use the per-component targets and separate
terminals when debugging one tier. Gateway port is `spec.gateway.port`
(example: `3847`); curl plugins at `http://127.0.0.1:<gateway-port>/api/...`.

Ctrl+C / SIGTERM stops components in reverse boot order (gateway → workers →
kernel) and always exits, even if a component's own shutdown hangs.

### Verify

```bash
mdk status                              # environment + Kernel/Gateway/worker health, exit code encodes it
mdk status -o json | jq .health
curl -s http://127.0.0.1:3847/api/<route> | jq .
```

`mdk status` never starts, stops or repairs anything — it probes the Kernel
over HRPC and the Gateway over HTTP and reports declared-vs-registered workers.
Exit codes: `0` healthy, `4` precondition not met (bad Node, invalid
`mdk.yaml`, packages not installed), `5` stack not fully up.

UI: `mdk run dashboard` (or `cd apps/dashboard && npm run dev` directly) and
open the page route added by `mdk-ui-component`.

## Scaffolding helpers

| Need | Command |
| --- | --- |
| Guided `mdk.yaml` | `mdk onboard` |
| New worker package | `mdk create worker <name>` → then `mdk-worker-plugin` |
| New gateway plugin | `mdk create plugin <name>` → then `mdk-gateway-plugin` |
| New dashboard app | `mdk create dashboard` |

All three run `npm install` by default (`--no-install` to skip) and, for
workers/plugins, install at the project root so the new package links as a
workspace member rather than getting its own nested `node_modules`.

## Boot-order invariant

1. Kernel listening
2. Workers announce on the DHT topic, or attach directly when run in the same process
3. Gateway loads plugins (needs Kernel + client)
4. UI last — it only talks to the Gateway

Starting the UI or a plugin before the worker is online yields empty arrays,
not necessarily HTTP errors — treat an empty `devices: []` in a plugin
response as a deployment signal, not a bug.



## Hand-off

| Next need | Skill |
| --- | --- |
| New device worker | `mdk-worker-plugin` |
| New aggregation API | `mdk-gateway-plugin` |
| New dashboard page | `mdk-ui-component` |
