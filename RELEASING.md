## Release checklist

Copy this into the PR or release ticket for each release.

### Prepare (private repo)

- [ ] Create release branch: `release/<version>`
- [ ] Update `"version"` in every `package.json` across [`ui/`](./ui/README.md), [`backend/core/`](./backend/core/README.md), [`backend/workers/`](./backend/workers/README.md), and `examples/`
- [ ] Update any pinned `^semver` `@tetherto/*` references in [`ui/packages/`](./ui/packages/) to match the new version
- [ ] Run installs in all three domains to refresh lockfiles: [`ui/`](./ui/README.md), [`backend/core/`](./backend/core/README.md), [`backend/workers/`](./backend/workers/README.md)
- [ ] Confirm no unexpected changes in [`package-lock.json`](./package-lock.json) files
- [ ] Update [`README.md`](./README.md) — version badge and any inline version references
- [ ] Add entry for `v<version>` in [`CHANGELOG.md`](./CHANGELOG.md)
- [ ] Add release notes file at `docs/reference/release-notes/<version>-release.md`
- [ ] Run tests — pass
- [ ] Run build — pass
- [ ] Private CI passes on the release branch

### Promote

- [ ] Promote the verified commit to the public repo (`mdk`)
- [ ] Spot-check a [`package.json`](./package.json) version to confirm the commit arrived intact

### Verify and tag (public repo)

- [ ] Confirm all `package.json` versions match the release version
- [ ] Public CI passes
- [ ] Create tag: `v<version>`
- [ ] Push tag to origin

### Publish

- [ ] Publish from the tagged commit
- [ ] Confirm published packages show the correct version
