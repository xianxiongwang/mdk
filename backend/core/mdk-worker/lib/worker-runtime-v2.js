/**
 * Host for a directory-loaded Worker Plugin — an mdk-contract.json plus handler
 * files, with no module to require and no connect() to call:
 *
 *   const runtime = new WorkerRuntimeV2(pkgDir, { workerId, kernelTopic, devices, env, config, storeDir })
 *
 * One HRPC server and one DHT identity for the process regardless of device
 * count, as in v1; what fans out per device is the plugin's module registry.
 * Pass `storeDir` (or `store`) so the DHT/RPC seeds — and therefore the
 * public key published to the Kernel — survive restarts.
 * Each device gets its own instance (see instance-loader.js), so handlers are
 * plain (params) functions that read `{ id, opts, env, config }` from the
 * ambient '@tetherto/mdk-worker/device' instead of taking a ctx argument. The
 * device list is fixed at construction.
 *
 * v1 is inherited whole — deviceId routing, the pull set, envelope wrapping,
 * param normalization, the service built-ins — because the contract's handler
 * table is filled with shims that resolve the addressed device's instance.
 *
 * Two behavior differences from v1: there is no boot-time probe, so every
 * declared device reports `online` and an unreachable one surfaces as an error
 * inside the telemetry payload rather than ERR_DEVICE_UNAVAILABLE; and there is
 * no disconnect, so whatever a plugin opens at load time lives until the
 * process exits.
 *
 * A builtin `health` telemetry channel is also registered into v1's own
 * handler table (see the constructor) so every contract-first plugin gets a
 * `TELEMETRY_PULL { query: { type: 'health' } }` channel with zero contract
 * changes, answered by `entry.instance.telemetry.get('health')` per device
 * (auto-injected by instance-loader.js). It routes through the exact same
 * dispatch v1 already uses for any real telemetry channel — no special
 * casing here.
